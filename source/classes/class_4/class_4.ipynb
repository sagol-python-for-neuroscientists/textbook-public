    "1. [IPython](https://ipython.org/): A REPL, much like the command window in MATLAB. Lets you write Python on the fly, debug and check the performance of your code, and much (much!) more.\n",
    "2. [NumPy](https://numpy.org/doc/stable/): Standard implementation of multi-dimensional arrays in Python. \n",
    "3. [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/): Notebooks designed for data exploration. Write code and see its output immediately, with useful rich text (Markdown) annotations to accompany it (just like this notebook!).\n",
    "4. [SciPy](https://www.scipy.org): Implements advanced algorithms widely used in scientific programming. Advanced linear algebra, data structures, curve fitting, signal processing, modeling and more.\n",
    "5. [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/): Visualizations of your data in Python with MATLAB-like interface.\n",
    "6. [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/index.html): Tabular data manipulation.\n",
    "7. [seaborn](http://seaborn.pydata.org/): Smart visualizations of tabular data.\n",
