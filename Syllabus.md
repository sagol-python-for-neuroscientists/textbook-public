# Syllabus of Python for Neuroscientists

The course is aimed at students who are already semi-proficient with other programming languages, namely Matlab. Examples (and homework) will be derived from common problems and tasks in neuroscience, to improve the analysis of your own data by increasing its automation and reproducibility.

__Prerequisites:__

1. Basic knowledge of programming.
2. Extended Mathematics course (in the Life Sciences faculty), or a parallel one. 

__Final Grade:__

* 40% - Homework assignments.
* 60% - Final project.

Each 3-hour lecture will start with an oral presentation, followed by individual work in the computer lab. Main topics of the course will include:

1. Motivation, transition from Matlab. 
2. Data structures (lists, tuples, sets, dictionaries), functions and iteration.
2. Object-oriented programming. 
3. File I/O and exception handling.
3. Python's scientific stack - NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib.
4. Important programming tools and habits - Package management, Git, unit tests.
5. Advanced Pandas - use cases, data organization. 
6. Bio-informatics and statistics in Python.
7. Integration of web tools for I/O, plotting and dashboards.
8. Image processing and basic machine learning.
9. Performant code - Cython, Numba, multiprocessing.
10. Advanced subjects - FFIs, generators, decorators, meta-programming.
