    "For the purposes of this walkthrough we'll assume we have some code inside a *my_project* directory, looking something like:\n",
    "- my_project/\n",
    "    - \\_\\_init\\_\\_.py\n",
    "    - code.py\n",
    "    - requirements.txt\n",
    "    - README.md\n",
    "\n",
    "Git can be run from the command line, but in this quick tutorial we'll be using the built-in Git interface in VSCode, which should be good enough for 99% of your Git needs. \n",
    "\n",
    "To start a new Git repository and host it on GitHub:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Open the project**: Open VSCode, click *File --> Open Folder...* (or Ctrl+K Ctrl+O) and select the *my_project* directory. ![VSC My Project](vsc_my_project.png) <br />\n",
    "2. **Initialize Git**: Click the <img src=\"vsc_vcs.png\" alt=\"VSC Version Control\" width=\"30\" style=\"display:inline\"></img> icon (or Ctrl+Shift+G G), and then \"Initialize Repository\".<br />![VSC Git init](vsc_git_init.png)<br />\n",
    "4. **Stage**: Next, we need to tell Git which files to track, which is called \"staging\" the files. Currently, we see our files and folders under the \"Changes\" headline, which means that these files are new to Git (since its previous snapshot of our repository is really a \"clean slate\" without any files).<br />![VSC VCS Changes](vsc_git_changes.png)<br />There's a <span style=\"color:green\">**U**</span> next to each file signifying that it's \"<span style=\"color:green\">**U**</span>ntracked\", i.e. Git has no prior records of this file. To start tracking the files, we can click the \"+\" button appearing next to the <span style=\"color:green\">**U**</span> when we hover over the file. ![VSC Git Stage](vsc_git_stage.png)<br />Alternatively, if we just want to add all files to the Git archive, we can click the \"+\" on the \"Changes\" line (again, visible when we hover with the mouse on it). Go ahead and stage all files. You should see them under a new headline: \"Staged Changes\", and showing an <span style=\"color:green\">**A**</span> for \"<span style=\"color:green\">**A**</span>dded\". ![VSC Git Staged](vsc_git_staged.png) Now Git knows what's inside the `my_project` folder, all files are tracked, but it hasn't captured a snapshot of the repository status quite yet. To do that, we'll need to \"commit\" the current state of the repository (repo). <br /><br />\n",
    "5. **Commit**: Committing essentially means creating a snapshot of our codebase which we can name, label, describe, and go back to. We always commit changes along with a concise message. The message goes in the line above \"Staged Changes\" - write \"Initial commit\" (it's good enough for the purposes of the tutorial). ![VSC Initial Commit](vsc_first_commit.png) Now we can commit by clicking the ✓ checkmark in the line above (or Ctrl+Enter while in the commit message textbox). So far, we merely created a local repo in our computer. If the whole folder is erased, our backups and commit history go away with it as well. <br /><br />\n",
    "6. **Push**: To make an online backup of a repository, we need to first set a \"remote\" (i.e. a remote location containing a copy of the repository). If you don't already have a [GitHub](https://www.github.com) account, create one, and then create a new repository: ![GitHub New Repo](github_new_repo.png) Give the repo a descriptive name create it. Now that you have a remote location to use (should be: https:\\/\\/github.com\\/\\<your-user-name\\>/\\<repo-name\\>), head back to VSCode and in the \"Source Control\" options select \"Add remote\": ![VSC Add Remote](vsc_add_remote.png) and finally we are ready to \"push\" our changes: ![VSC Git Push](vsc_git_push.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Congratulations! You've published your first code repository! Whether you find it trivial or confusing, you've made a huge step towards creating software that will not only work better for you, but also for others."

    "One of the largest differences between Python and MATLAB is the concept of namespaces. \n",
    "\n",
    "Namespaces provide a system to avoid ambiguity. We have many Hagai's, but much less Hagai Har-Gil's. In computers, we can have many files with the name `test1.py` saved in _different folders_ of our harddrive. In contrast - we can only have one `test1.py` per folder, since the file system dislikes these collisions. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, In Python we have to declare which namespace does our function belong to. Usually functions aren't included in the scope of the program until we `import` them. After importing we can use the function with its \"pathname\", i.e. the module it belongs to. This way, the same identifier (function name, class name, etc.) can be used multiple times in different modules.\n",

    "As noted before, Python's gigantic ecosystem is one of its biggest strengths. And the fact that you can easily install many of these package with a simple command-line instruction is even more important. The standard tool to do that is `pip`, a recursive acronym that stands for \"`pip` installs Python\".\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip` itself is a Python program, __but its not run from inside the Python interpreter.__ Instead its run from a shell - the Windows command line (or PowerShell), for example, or the Mac's terminal - making it an external application to Python. Happily enough, basically all Python distributions come with `pip` pre-installed, so you don't have to install it yourself.\n",
    "\n",
    "To install a library with pip, open a command line (in VSCode you can simply press Ctrl + ~) and type `pip install package_name`. \n",
    "\n",
    "`pip`, like any package manager, has two main jobs. The first is to provide a convenient API to a package repository. In essence, it's a download manager for a single site - the [Python Package Index](https://pypi.python.org/pypi) (PyPI, pronounced **pai-pee-eye**), the official Python repository for packages.\n",
    "\n",
    "PyPI holds installation files for the packages hosted in it, alongside with some metadata, like version number and dependencies. `pip` (and other tools we'll discuss soon) downloads the wanted package from PyPI, together with its dependencies, and installs them in a pre-defined location in our personal computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "`pip`'s second important job is handling dependencies. Many packages rely on other packages, which in turn rely on other, more basic packages, finally leading to the basic Python interpreter. `pip` has to make sure to install all dependencies of the package you're currently after, and to avoid any collisions with other installed packages. For example, a common problem in the Python world is the Python 2-3 schism, which means that packages written for Python 2 can't run on a Python 3 interpreter, and vice versa. The package manger's job is to grant you the right version of the package you're looking for."

    "### Comparison with MATLAB's approach\n",
    "\n",
    "We should take a minute here to contrast Python's approach with that of MATLAB. In MATLAB, once we added a directory to the path using `pathtool`, each file in that file is now directly in the MATLAB namespace. This means that we don't have to `import` anything - adding something to `pathtool` is essentially `import`ing the entire folder into the general namespace, which is the only namespace in MATLAB world. This is a pretty straight-forward approach, but it's also one that no other programming language, especially a modern one, uses. This is because cluttering the one and only namespace is a bad idea, since you can quite easily overwrite names of functions from files with names of variables you use, and you won't even know it. Moreover, you don't need **all** functions around **all** the time. Each file and project will usually need a few different functions from a couple of toolboxes, and that's it. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python we have another layer between our code and the `import`-able functions. Inside our code we can only use built-in functions (`list()`, `int()`, `print()`, etc.) and functions that we explicitly imported, which will vary between files and project. In addition, we can only call `import` on files and packages which are in our Python's path. We'll discuss Python's equivilant of `pathtool` in the next class, but for now you should see the separation Python forces on us between the specific file's namespace and the general Python namespace (what packages can we even import)."

    "If you're familiar with MATLAB there's a good chance that you've written a script before. A script is a file which is run sequentially, while using other functions and definitions. Python supports scripts as well, as can be seen in `main.py`.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, in the Python world people usually prefer to stay away from scripts. This is due to a number of reasons, the most important one being that running a `main()` function as it is easy as running a `main.py` script. You can see examples of a procedural and script-like approach in the `main.py` file, but keep in mind the the script version is discouraged.\n",

    "Every Python file which is being run has a caller. If this file was run directly from the Python interpreter its `__name__` will be `'__main__'`. This `if` statement basically tells the Python interpreter \"Start from here\", and is the conventional way to run Python procedures.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this course you're highly encouraged to divide your code into many small functions and methods in well-defined compact classes. Each method should have a single purpose, documented in its docstring. Each class should have a logical structure that envelopes its methods and attributes in a sensible way.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beware of God classes, or God scripts and functions. These are monolithic objects that encompass the entirety of your application, and are very hard to reason about. Simply create more files, each with a descriptive name and a bunch of related functions, and import this file into the other folders and main file.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important reason to partition our code into many small bits is *unit testing* which we'll cover later on in the course.\n",

    "Importing code from one file to the other isn't as easy as you'd like it to be, especially since each language deals with this issue in a different way. It's completely expected that you won't be able to 'nail' the first couple of import statements you write. Keep trying, verify that your code is in the right directory structure, and don't be afraid to ask friends, Google or me."
