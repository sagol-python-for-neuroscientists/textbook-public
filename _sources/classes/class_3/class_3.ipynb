    "One of the most interesting aspects or features of object-oriented programming is _inheritance_. Inheritance is a specific type of relation between the objects we create that signifies that a \"child\" object _inherits_ from its \"parent\". In other words, the child object __\"is a\"__ parent object. Our examples so far were of \"real-life\" objects, and so to continue this line we'd perhaps wish to create a class of a `Person`, which would be the parent class, and a child class of a `Student`. In this examples it's clear why a `Student` __is a__ `Person`, so the inheritance holds. All `Person` instances have a name, age, gender, etc., but only `Student` instances have an associated school and a final grade. This means that the `Student` will have all attributes associated with all `Person`s (name, age, gender), and they'll also have a school and a grade, the is referred to as \"inheritance\".\n",
    "\n",
    "Say that we have some computational pipeline, that reads some data, preprocesses it (denoising, filtering, changing its dimensions), then it computes some measurement of that dataset (number of cells in the image, mean calcium activity, min-max of electrical activity) and finally it writes it to disk. Let's focus on the first step of this pipeline - reading in the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Computational pipeline](pipeline_oop_inheritance.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "Our approach will be the following: we will build a parent class called `DataReader`, and its child classes will know how to read in specific data formats only. In the graph above we'll have two child implementations: one that can read *.tif* images, and one for *.png*. This will allow us to \"plug in\" different classes into our pipeline, depending on the input, and the downstream functions won't see a difference."
