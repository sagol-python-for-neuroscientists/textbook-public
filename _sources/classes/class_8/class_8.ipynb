Unfortunately, the article as published in 2018 is completely wrong. The original conclusion was that these dynamic circles improved the understanding of what was said, while the truth is they worsened it. The fault lied in a very simple mistake in the source code, still visible due to the author's comment (line ~25 in the link above), which resulted in opposite results.\n",

    "Another famous example from the COVID-19 outbreak is the code used for official epidemiological simulations in the UK. The code was [made public](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/) and turned out to be a huge mess. It even prompted a huge discussion all across the internet (and in the [repo itself](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/165)) with people urging officials to not take any action that was suggested by results of this simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"truth\" of the matter, if there is such one, is much more complex. The code, originally a 15k LOC `.c` file - revolves around a model that was created in 2005 and used in many important scientific publications. These publications were peer-reviewed, and the articles themselves are considered very helpful and important in their respective field. The code had very few tests, but the scientists who wrote it \"tested\" their code in a more intuitive manner - they gave simple inputs for which they knew the expected answer for. They also visualized many of the results the model generated to make sure nothing suspicious is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scientists released their code to the public with good intentions, advocating \"open science\", but received a very unwelcoming response from the community, especially from software engineers. These types of reactions really don't encourage more scientists and labs to release their code to the public space, which ultimately is the right thing to do. In this case, many people started helping with the refactoring process, including people like [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack). This process uncovered bugs and made the code more readable and hopefully a bit more trustworthy, but there's still much more work to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we do better? There are basic, simple tools we can acquire as researchers that make a large difference. We've touched on we should design our code and mentioned concepts such as *parameterization* and *encapsulation*. We've also emphasized the importance of *readability* and including expansive *documentation*. Another one of the tools is testing, and if you learn to integrate it adequately into your coding process it will dramatically elevate the quality of your work."

For example, in the aviation industry, for each line of code a software has, you may find about 8 lines dedicated to testing it.\n",

For example, a function that adds two numbers needs a `isinstance(value, (int, float))` somewhere near its top to avoid these mistakes. Statically-typed languages, like C, define a type for each variable. A function adding two integers simply cannot accept a non-integer input. "

    "We could perhaps continue a bit more, but I think that the principle is clear. \n",

    "Before moving on to a more difficult example, let's examine a few more features of tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The test functions have **no docstring, very long names, and a concise body**. This allows them to be very readable, fast to execute, and very low chance that they themselves will contain any bugs.\n",
    "2. Writing tests **forces us to design an \"API\"** of the function. API stands for application programming interface, and it's usually a property of large libraries, but here we mean that after writing the tests, the function can only output something meaningful only if you use it in a very strict way, which is great. This makes sure that bugs won't just spread throughout the execution, but will stop at some point.\n",
    "3. There are many **more lines of of testing code than of the actual function** that's being tested. This is usually a sign of good coding practices.\n",
    "4. Some people write the tests before the actual function, known as **test-driven development (TDD)**. In this method you first think of edge cases and possible inputs, write a tests that fails, and then corrects the function until the test passes.\n",
    "5. Pytest has a ton of other features which we won't cover. [Here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/parametrize.html#basic-pytest-generate-tests-example) is one link for the basics, and [here](https://hackebrot.github.io/pytest-tricks/create_tests_via_parametrization/) you can find a clear blog post giving more information about parameterization.\n",
    "6. Tests should be run as often as possible, to make sure that your changes aren't affecting the existing behavior of your code.\n",
    "7. You should try very hard to **\"translate\" bugs into tests**. These might be the most important tests you'll write."

[Here's](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/483cd3eaa/sklearn/preprocessing/_data.py#L200) the class and [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/483cd3eaa3c636a57ebb0dc4765531183b274df0/sklearn/preprocessing/tests/test_data.py#L731) are its tests.
