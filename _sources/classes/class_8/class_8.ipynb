Unfortunately, the article as published in 2018 is completely wrong. The original conclusion was that these dynamic circles improved the understanding of what was said, while the truth is they worsened it. The fault lied in a very simple mistake in the source code, still visible due to the author's comment (line ~25 in the link above), which resulted in opposite results.\n",

    "Another famous example from the COVID-19 outbreak is the code used for official epidemiological simulations in the UK. The code was [made public](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/) and turned out to be a huge mess. It even prompted a huge discussion all across the internet (and in the [repo itself](https://github.com/mrc-ide/covid-sim/issues/165)) with people urging officials to not take any action that was suggested by results of this simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The \"truth\" of the matter, if there is such one, is much more complex. The code, originally a 15k LOC `.c` file - revolves around a model that was created in 2005 and used in many important scientific publications. These publications were peer-reviewed, and the articles themselves are considered very helpful and important in their respective field. The code had very few tests, but the scientists who wrote it \"tested\" their code in a more intuitive manner - they gave simple inputs for which they knew the expected answer for. They also visualized many of the results the model generated to make sure nothing suspicious is happening.\n",
    "\n",
    "The scientists released their code to the public with good intentions, advocating \"open science\", but received a very unwelcoming response from the community, especially from software engineers. These types of reactions really don't encourage more scientists and labs to release their code to the public space, which ultimately is the right thing to do. In this case, many people started helping with the refactoring process, including people like [John Carmack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Carmack). This process uncovered bugs and made the code more readable and hopefully a bit more trustworthy, but there's still much more work to do.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, how can we do better? There are basic, simple tools we can acquire as researchers that make a large difference. We've touched on we should design our code and mentioned concepts such as *parameterization* and *encapsulation*. We've also emphasized the importance of *readability* and including expansive *documentation*. Another one of the tools is testing, and if you learn to integrate it adequately into your coding process it will dramatically elevate the quality of your work."

For example, in the aviation industry, for each line of code a software has, you may find about 8 lines dedicated to testing it.\n",

For example, a function that adds two numbers needs a `isinstance(value, (int, float))` somewhere near its top to avoid these mistakes. Statically-typed languages, like C, define a type for each variable. A function adding two integers simply cannot accept a non-integer input. "

    "We could perhaps continue a bit more, but I think that the principle is clear. \n",

    "Before moving on to a more difficult example, let's examine a few more features of tests:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The test functions have **no docstring, very long names, and a concise body**. This allows them to be very readable, fast to execute, and very low chance that they themselves will contain any bugs.\n",
    "2. Writing tests **forces us to design an \"API\"** of the function. API stands for application programming interface, and it's usually a property of large libraries, but here we mean that after writing the tests, the function can only output something meaningful only if you use it in a very strict way, which is great. This makes sure that bugs won't just spread throughout the execution, but will stop at some point.\n",
    "3. There are many **more lines of of testing code than of the actual function** that's being tested. This is usually a sign of good coding practices.\n",
    "4. Some people write the tests before the actual function, known as **test-driven development (TDD)**. In this method you first think of edge cases and possible inputs, write a tests that fails, and then corrects the function until the test passes.\n",
    "5. Pytest has a ton of other features which we won't cover. [Here](https://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/parametrize.html#basic-pytest-generate-tests-example) is one link for the basics, and [here](https://hackebrot.github.io/pytest-tricks/create_tests_via_parametrization/) you can find a clear blog post giving more information about parameterization.\n",
    "6. Tests should be run as often as possible, to make sure that your changes aren't affecting the existing behavior of your code.\n",
    "7. You should try very hard to **\"translate\" bugs into tests**. These might be the most important tests you'll write."

[Here's](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/483cd3eaa/sklearn/preprocessing/_data.py#L200) the class and [here](https://github.com/scikit-learn/scikit-learn/blob/483cd3eaa3c636a57ebb0dc4765531183b274df0/sklearn/preprocessing/tests/test_data.py#L731) are its tests.

    "## Linting\n",
    "\n",
    "The word \"lint\" means fluff (fibers and dirt), hinting at the action being performed – \"cleaning\" and optimizing the code. In general, a linter is a tool designed to identify logical (execution issues, \"bugs\") and stylistic errors in a way that allows for the identification and correction of code parts likely to cause errors or that are not written according to the conventions of the programming language being used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in Python, a linter can identify unused variables (which won't cause a runtime error), unmatched parentheses, variables that are used but not defined (which will cause runtime errors), etc. The linter also highlights these errors in a way that hints at the type of error by emphasizing the parts of the code causing it (moreover, a message describing the type of error will appear in a small window if you hover over the highlighted piece of code).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many types of linters for Python, differing in the types of errors they identify and fix. For example, some linters identify both logical and stylistic errors (like [Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)), while others identify only one type of error (logical or stylistic, like PyFlakes or pycodestyle, respectively). Additionally, there are combo-linters (multi-linters?) that combine the functionalities of several different linters (like [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) and [Pylama](https://klen.github.io/pylama/)). From my experience, [Pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and [Flake8](https://flake8.pycqa.org/en/latest/) are the most popular."

    "## Formatting:\n",
    "\n",
    "As the name suggests, formatting organizes the code. Its main purpose is to arrange the code uniformly so that all code related to a project is written under the same stylistic conventions (spaces between operators and variables, number of spaces defining a \"tab\", maximum number of characters per line before splitting it, etc.). Generally, it's important to use a formatter to style the code because it allows us to maintain uniformity and readability, which helps when collaborating with fellow programmers on the same piece of code or project.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are several tools available for formatting as well (formatters?), each offering a different approach to styling. For example, [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), one of the most popular formatters, does not arrange imported packages in a specific order, although [PEP8](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) (the official style guide for Python code) has several rules for ordering imports. Conversely, [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/) focuses solely on the task of arranging imports in the code. In fact, there has been an almost 4 years-long discussion about integrating import sorting into [Black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)'s functionality, but it was [decided to keep them apart at the end](https://github.com/psf/black/issues/333#issuecomment-1153637034).\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, there are other formatters like autopep8 and [YAPF](https://github.com/google/yapf) (short for Yet Another Python Formatter, kudos for the name), which are more similar to Black but operate under different assumptions about the code and focus on different aspects of it.\n",
    "Finally, although the dry definition of the formatter's task falls under the linter's tasks, each excels in its field and is sensitive to different types of stylistic issues in the code. So, rather than differing from each other, they complement each other and help us write code that works properly (linting), in a readable and efficient manner (linting and formatting)."
