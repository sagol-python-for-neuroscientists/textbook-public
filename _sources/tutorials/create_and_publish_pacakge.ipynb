    "The simplest way to share our code is to send a `.py` file to someone by mail. If the receiver has a Python interpreter installed, he can just run the file by writing `python new_file.py` in his command line. This has a few short-comings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The script was written in a specific Python version. You might have to make sure that your receiver has the same Python version.\n",
    "2. If it's more than one script, you have to bundle scripts together and make sure they remain in the same directory when run.\n",

    "    * Create `README.md` and write inside a single line describing the project.\n",
    "    * Create an empty `CHANGELOG.md` file.\n",
    "    * Create `.gitignore` and copy-paste the content from [here](https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore).\n",
    "    * Create a `src` folder, and inside it create a folder with the name of your project **in snake case**. In our case, the folder is `src/parse_stuff`. Inside that folder create a `__init__.py` file.\n",
    "    * Create a file named `LICENSE` (no suffix needed) and copy the content from [here](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/). This is the MIT license which gives other people permission to basically do whatever they want with your code. Make sure to replace the \"year\" and \"name\" placeholders.\n",
