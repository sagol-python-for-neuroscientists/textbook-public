Rather, they're goal is to run some calculation which is very specific for the current application you're working on. Perhaps they're automatically inserting experiment dates into a database you generated, or they're filtering files in a directory per some heuristic.\n",

Now your code base reflects your undestanding of the code - the internal methods are indeed specific to this object alone, and are unusable outside of the current task at hand."

    "Before we start exercising, one important note to remember: There's a thin line between under- and over-engineering. Very small scripting projects require almost no engineering at all. This might mean that after you gain a few extra months of experience in Python, the structure of code for a small scripting job in Python might be obvious for you right from the get-go. You'll know which data structures you'll have, whether or not you'll need a class or two, and how the user interface might go.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, large applications which span at least a few thousands lines of code will always need _some_ form of pre-planning. It would be senseless not to write out a diagram of the main modules in your code and their interfaces. One can consider this to be common knowledge, or a simple programmer's instinct. Just like architects sit down and plan for months in advance the construct what they're about to create, programmers should spell out the architecture of their own programs. In no way will this guarantee you'll get the architecture right in the first time, but the design might serve as good building blocks when you start the refactoring process."

    "Problems mostly occur when you write medium-sized scripts, up to a couple thousand lines. These scripts usually start out small - a few functions that deal with file I/O and display of data - but can grow quite quickly once you start adding functionality. When the script was short you probably didn't even write tests, since you were sure you're handling some insignificant piece of code, and now it starts biting back at you.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's hard to write rules for these occasions. When someone asks me for improved functionality on some short script I wrote, I sometimes tell them it will take more time than I think it should, since I want to devote time to refactor the code, add tests and make the new functionality feel more natural inside it.\n",
