    "As we said earlier this year, our goal in this course is not only to learn Python, it's also to learn how to write better code. As you all know, one of best methods to solve problems is \"divide and conquer\". By this I mean that as a first step when encountering a new problem - a HW assignment or a scientific question - is to divide it into smaller parts and solve each part separately. This method works in our day to day research, and it's also extremely important when writing code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In code, these \"smaller parts\" are obviously functions or class methods. In MATLAB this wasn't encouraged too much, since until very recently you were unable to create a file containing more than one function, or a function and a script. This meant that if you wanted to \"divide and conquer\" your algorithm, by the time you're done you'd end up with hundreds of files, some of them only containing a few lines of code. In Python this technical difficulty doesn't exist - you may write as many functions as you'd like in a single file, and `import` some (or all) of them to other files and modules.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the technical difficulties aren't really an issue, let's drill down by looking at a slightly more concrete example. Assume I need to write the pre-processing steps for some cell counting software\\algorithm that someone else wrote for me. The first thing I do when trying to solve this type of puzzle is to decompose it into its main parts. Then I'll go over each part and de-structure it further, until I'm left with small enough units of work, which will become individual functions. In principle, the thought process may follow the following mock diagram:\n",
    "\n",
    "![Examplary modular approach (made with Diagram.Codes)](extra_material/cell_counting_algo_line_of_thought.svg)\n",
    "\n",
    "Here each rectangle is a unit of work I need to do, and I sometimes add the function name that connects a rectangle to the next one, if I feel like this information is useful. The different steps show how I progressed from having a general concept of the software I'm about to write, to having a pretty concrete graph which I should \"copy-paste\" into my code, in the form of functions, of course. I.e., all that's left for me to do after writing the graph explicitly like that is to actually implement the code. This process, at the beginning, won't be too natural, but after a few times I'm sure it'll be much easier for you, perhaps to a point in which for most algorithms you don't even need to draw them out on paper.\n",
    "\n",
    "The important thing to remember here is that each component or function should do exactly one thing, and do it well. Even if that thing is very small, and\\or very simple, it should still be its own function."

    "As you can see, not all rectangles are independent functions - although they definitely could be. For one reason or the other I decided to keep some of the code inside the main function, and move some other parts to an independent function. Usually the underlying reason has to do with code reusability, or the question \"how likely it is that I'll re-use this code snippet somewhere else?\". If the answer is \"likely\" then I'd take that chunk of code and extract it to a function, since later I might have to write another piece of code that needs the exact same functionality. In our current case, I decided that writing out to disk is a \"general\" function that could be re-used elsewhere.\n",
    "\n",
    "If reusability is the guiding principle, why did I factor out `convert`? Well, because there are other considerations. In the `convert` case, I decided that the reader of `english_to_morse` needs to see the full picture of the function, and some details might be of lesser interest. The `convert` function uses very clear arguments (the data and the dictionary) and outputs a new data variable, so a naive reader can easily understand what's going on here without checking exactly how am I converting the file. Besides, the actual `convert` operation might be costly and complicated, and these details will \"bury\" the logic and flow of `english_to_morse`, decreasing readability even further.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a final comment, I wish to remind you that both the `convert` and the `to_disk` functions are extremely short. Here's `to_disk`, docstring removed:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "def to_disk(data: str, file: pathlib.Path):\n",
    "    try:\n",
    "        with open(file, \"w\") as f:\n",
    "            f.write(data)\n",
    "    except PermissionError as e:\n",
    "        print(f\"Error: {e}. Data is still accessible in 'data' variable.\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "All this function does is write something to disk, and report if it fails. These five lines of code could easily fit inside `english_to_morse`, but moving this unit of work into its own function improves readability and reusability of our code, which are two huge pluses.\n",
    "\n",
    "To summarize, I found the smallest components of `english_to_morse`, written an outline of how would my solution look like, and finally I coded it together. Later on in the course we'll see two interesting aspects in which this process could be better."

    "1. Remember to use `with` blocks to open files, just as I did above.\n",
