A repository contains both the standard files we're working on, and a compressed copy of them inside the `.git` folder.\n",

Due to these reasons it's suggested to commit a lot and often. It's very cheap to commit and it will provide you with a clear history of the changes in your repo. Changed a function's signature? Commit. Added documentation? Commit. You basically commit everytime you feel like you feel the need to save the file (even though VSCode does that automatically)."

If anyone could push to any repo they cloned things would go crazy pretty fast. Instead, I'll fork that repo, work on that forked copy and when I wish to introduce this feature to the `pandas` devs I'll make a _Pull Request_ which showcases my changes. A pull request is a way to \"connect\" a fork to its origin repo; it's an event which happens in the original repo in which the developers see that someone forked their codebase, changed something and now wishes to merge it back. They can review this change, perhaps ask for more clarifications and then merge it if they deem it worthy.

    "The graphical processing unit, or GPU, is a \"special\" processor inside your computer that is able to perform simple tasks very quickly. It's very bad at replacing a standard computational processing unit (CPU), but it can add numbers really fast - much faster than the CPU - which can be very useful sometimes. A long time ago GPUs were only useful for the gaming industry, but since the rise of ML GPUs became super important and widespread, and today they can be found in most computers and servers. Using these GPUs effectively can speed up some computational pipelines by orders of magnitude.\n",

We won't go into too much detail here but code that should be run on the GPU has to be compiled for that specific GPU beforehand, so something needs to do that work for us. CUDA helps in this regard, and once it's installed on your machine it will be much easier to work effectively with your card."
