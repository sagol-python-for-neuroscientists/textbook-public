    "Write a class that returns the difference between the Fibonacci series and the prime numbers series, up to some _n._ The output should be an array of numbers, n-items long, and a plot to accompany it. As an example, for $n=3$, I expect the array to be `np.array([-2, -2, -4])`. Write the class in a test-driven development style.\n",

    "A reminder, the Fibonacci series is a series of numbers starting from (0, 1), with its next element being the sum of the previous two numbers: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, ... Prime numbers start from 2 and are only divisible by themselves and 1 without a remainder.\n",
