    "The \"dumbest\" way to do it is to send a `.py` file to someone by mail. If the receiver has a Python interpreter installed, he can just run the file by writing `python new_file.py` in his command line. This has a few short-comings:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The script was written in a specific Python version. You have to make sure that your receiver has the same Python version.\n",

    "3. Nearly all scripts have dependencies. There's no way to verify that the receiver truly has all the dependencies and is using the same version of dependencies that you're using.\n",

We'll discuss most of them later on, but for now you should note that your actual code goes into the folder named like your project (it will already have an `__init__.py` file waiting, as well as a `parse_stuff.py` \"main\" file).
