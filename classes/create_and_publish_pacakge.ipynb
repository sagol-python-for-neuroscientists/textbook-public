    "1. The script was written in a specific Python version. You have to make sure that your receiver has the same Python version.\n",

Lastly we added a `setup.py` file which is basically a configuration\\metadata file that defines how will our package be packaged. It's a standard Python file but it has a pretty weird syntax since it doesn't deal with the code, it deals with code generation. You can see a few fields containing the name of the package and other things related to it, but it's mostly cryptic and shouldn't be of much concern at the moment.
